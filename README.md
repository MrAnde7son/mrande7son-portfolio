# Itamar Mizrahi - Personal Portfolio & Blog

Welcome to my personal website and blog where I share insights about cybersecurity, engineering leadership, and building security products. 

## About Me

I'm a seasoned technology leader and entrepreneur with extensive experience in cybersecurity. I have a proven track record in building and scaling software products from inception to growth. As the former Co-founder and CEO of Cymptom (acquired by Tenable), I've experienced the full journey of building security products from startup to enterprise scale.

My passion lies in building high-impact security products that protect organizations from evolving cyber threats. I enjoy mentoring the next generation of security professionals and sharing insights from my experience in both startup and enterprise environments.
